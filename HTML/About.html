        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>My interest in the IT industry began after finishing my Chemical Engineering degree in University. I was very much interested in the booming industry and how the process of development, testing and everything in between worked in the IT sector. I was also intrigued by the different programming languages, how they differ and how they are each used in different functions. I also felt that the industry is growing with exciting job prospects for the future and that investing my time in IT would suit my skills I developed from university.</p> 

        <p>I was still unsure as to what area of the IT industry I wanted to pursue. That is one of the reasons I decided to join QA and follow their consulting pathway. The range of different opportunities they offer and the range of clients they provided for certainly appealed to me. I'm looking to achieve my professional and personal goals with QA. </p>
        
        <h2>Experience</h2>
    
        <h4>QA Consulting - Consultant<br>
            January 2018 - Present</h4>
        
        
        <h4>DevOps</h4>
        <p>My training culminated with the delivery of a DevOps and Continuous Integration project. The task was to set up a CI pipeline provisioning all instances on AWS and Docker containers using Ansible playbooks. This includes using Jenkins, Git, Maven and Nexus. This project was done in groups so Scrum was employed as the project management framework. 

        During the project I had the task of implementing Ansible to spin up EC2 instances in AWS that implemented and ran Docker containers for the different resources. With the expertise of my team members we successfully delivered our pipeline within the time constraint and presented it to our peers, trainers and academy staff. </p>
        
        <h4>AWS</h4>
        <p>Throughout my DevOps training with QA, I completed a series of labs and exercises around the usage of AWS services. AWS provides a wide range of cloud based services from creating virtual machines using EC2 instances, to data storage with S3 buckets and network monitoring using CloudWatch. Using IAM roles to set and manage access to resources was also a skill developed during my time at QA using AWS services. </p>
        
        <h4>Automated Testing  </h4>
        <p>With QA I was introduced to automated testing, primarily using JUnit testing and Selenium. The course has concluded with a project to test multiple websites and generate extent reports to present my findings. 

        I am currently working towards my BCS-ISTQB Software Testing Foundation Qualification.  </p>
        
        <h4>Continuous Integration </h4>
        <p>This was my first experience of using the technologies in the DevOps field. We began by familiarising ourselves with Linux running Bash Scripts, Git and Vagrant environments. This also included repository management tools, mainly Git, using the open source BItbucket tool to push and pull code to and from repositories. We also discussed build tools and project management tools to complete the CI pipeline. Our final project at the end of the week was to write a shell script to build a vagrant virtual machine and install Java, Maven, Git, Jenkins when the vagrant command was run. This also included configuring Git and Jenkins to manage and maintain our project. </p>
        
        <h4>SQL</h4>
        <p>During my time with QA I was introduced to databases and SQL. The principles and the syntax behind SQL languages were the main learning points and these were implemented by creating basic tables and running some simple and complex queries to find the relevant data from the database. </p>
        
        <h4>Java SE </h4>
        <p>During my time at QA I have completed a series of focused week-long modules aimed at learning the syntax, logic, and data structure behind the Java programming languages, as well as the principles of object-orientated and functional programming. These concepts were put into practice by writing simple programs, participating in pair programming, and working in larger group projects within the class.</p>
        
        <h4>Agile/Scrum  </h4>
        <p>I started my time with QA learning the basics behind the Agile and Scrum methodologies and the main advantages and disadvantages of using them. Also the justification of why the methodologies are used primarily in industry and how they will be implemented in the workplace. These were very useful in building skills in problem solving, teamwork and presentation.</p>
        
        <h4>Opta Sports Analyst<br>
            March 2017 - Present</h4>
        <p>Currently working part time as an Opta analyst, where handling and manipulating data is essential, and deriving accurate and concise conclusions is required. Problem solving skills are required daily and IT skills are shown by working with computer software to update and analyze the data.

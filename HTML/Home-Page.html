        <p> Welcome to my website, this website is to show my developing skills in the IT industry broadcasting the different projects I have been working on in my free time.

        <h2>My Profile</h2>
        <p>My interest in the IT industry began after finishing my Chemical Engineering degree in University. I was very much interested in the booming industry and how the process of development, testing and everything in between worked in the IT sector. I was also intrigued by the different programming languages, how they differ and how they are each used in different functions. I also felt that the industry is growing with exciting job prospects for the future and that investing my time in IT would suit my skills I developed from university.</p> 

        <p>I was still unsure as to what area of the IT industry I wanted to pursue. That is one of the reasons I decided to join QA and follow their consulting pathway. The range of different opportunities they offer and the range of clients they provided for certainly appealed to me. I'm looking to achieve my professional and personal goals with QA. </p>
